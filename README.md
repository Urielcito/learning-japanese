### Personal repository just for keeping track of my japanese learnings
---
# To-do:
Finish up the remaining markdown files
# Studyflow:
A Session is a serious time consuming task where I dedicate myself to learning a specific thing about the language.
	- Vocabulary learned in the session will be stored in the [vocabulary file](vocabulary.md).
	- Grammar learned in the session will be stored in the [grammar file](grammar.md).
	- Kanjis learned in the session will be stored in the [kanji file](kanji.md)
	- The Session itself will be logged in the [sessions folder](study%sessions)
	
After 5 sessions, I can not continue studying until I complete all of the required exercises explained below to make sure the knowledge stayed in my brain
	- In case of something not persisting, It's not a big deal, since the purpose of the review is to basically re-learn so I will be peeking at the stored resources in the repo to help me.
	
A review will occur every 5 sessions and it consists of questions specifically made to re-learn and re-inforce my learnings from those last 5 sessions.
	- Amount of questions is determined by the nature of the sessions covered
	- Covers *all* the vocabulary, grammar and kanjis learned, extensively.
	
A test will take place every 10 sessions, just after a review.
	- Amount of questions should range between 2-3 questions.
	- Covers the most important parts of each topic learned.
	- Only covers all the vocabulary through a "connect the words" question.
	
An exam will take place every 20 sessions, just after a test. 
	- There will be a "write sentences with the words XXX" question.
	- There will be a "connect the words" question.
	- Is meant to generally assure that I still have an understanding of the last things I learned.
